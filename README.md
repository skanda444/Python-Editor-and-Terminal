# Python Editor and Terminal

This is a web-based Python editor and terminal application. You can write and execute Python code directly in your browser.

## Live Application

You can access the live application here:
[**Launch Python Editor & Terminal**](https://python-terminal1.netlify.app)

## How it Works

* **Frontend:** Built with [Your Frontend Framework/Library, e.g., React, Vue, plain HTML/CSS/JS] and deployed on Netlify.
* **Backend:** A Node.js server that uses `python-shell` to execute Python code, deployed on Render.

## Features

* Write Python code in an integrated editor.
* Execute code and see output in a terminal-like interface.
* (Add any other features your application has)

## Setup (For Developers)

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* Python (3.x recommended)
* Git

### Backend Setup (Node.js)

1.  Clone this repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/skanda444/Python-Editor-and-Terminal.git`
2.  Navigate to the `server` directory:
    `cd Python-Editor-and-Terminal/server`
3.  Install dependencies:
    `npm install`
4.  Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add:
    `NETLIFY_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:<YOUR_FRONTEND_PORT>` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` if your frontend runs on 3000)
5.  Start the backend server:
    `npm start`

### Frontend Setup (Your Frontend Framework/Library)

1.  Navigate to the `client` (or `frontend`) directory:
    `cd ../client` (adjust path if your frontend is not in `client`)
2.  Install dependencies:
    `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3.  Start the frontend development server:
    `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port) and connect to your local backend.
